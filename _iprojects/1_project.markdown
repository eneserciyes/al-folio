Education is an important component of building a more inclusive astronomical community. To educate scientiests about diversity, equity, and includion, I facilitate department-wide discussion groups that work on these issues, including one at [AIP](https://www.aip.de/en/career/gender-equality/gleichstellung-journal-club?set_language=en) and at my former institution, [OSU](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~schmidt/DiversityJournalClub.html).

These groups are loosely styled around journal clubs, because there is a wealth of research on discrimination and on inclusive practice. However, some people have their own research or lived experience of margnalization to share, and those contributions are especially encouraged. At their best, these discussion group spur action on large and small scales both within research groups and departments as well as the field and world at large.
