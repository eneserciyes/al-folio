Many people have sat in the questions sessions after conference presentations and wondered why it always seems to be the same few people -- often senior white men -- asking questions. In 2014, my collaborator [Jim Davenport](http://jradavenport.github.io/) created a quick web form so conference attendees (at the 223rd meeting of AAS) could track the gender of speakers and those asking questions. Over the next five years, Jim, myself, [Stephanie Douglas](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~sdouglas/), and many others worked to disseminate the form, assign genders, and analyze the data.

Over the course of dozens of conferences, we found that the fraction of women who asks questions typically lags 10% behind the fraction of women in attendance. The fraction of women asking questions showed only a small (positive) change if the speaker or session chair was female. The fraction of women who ask questions did show a strong increase in longer question sessions, so one of our main conclusions is more equitable questions sessions should last longer. Our main results for AAS conferences are shown below.

    <b>Left:</b> The fraction of male and female questioners and speakers at four successive winter AAS meetings. In addition to the data from individual meetings (with Poisson uncertainties shown), the mean for all four meetings is indicated (dashed lines). The results from individual meetings show no significant change over four years. 
<b>Right:</b> The fraction of questions asked by women as a function of the total number of questions taken during the session. For sessions with three to five questions, the fraction increases, and in sessions with six to nine questions, the fraction of questions from women is consistent with that the fraction of female speakers and
attendees at the conference.

Over five years, we were able to quantify a previously untracked gender disparity, but this phase of the survey is over. <b>However, we no longer endorse the use of our web form for gathering data.</b> The web form was deployed with buttons for M/F, reinforcing the gender binary. Additionally, as the survey became more popular, it caused harm to those who prefer to interact scientifically without observers conciously labeling them with a gender, which includes, but is not limited to, those outside the gender binary. We released [this statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1jlNO3h7AAgRj037jFnM9wWY_w0RI5TKxQKVq9bPdo/edit?usp=sharing) to apologize and annouce the end of the survey. 

Where do we go next? I am eager to learn more about scientific interactions at conferences and experiment with new ideas and paradigms to support those itneractions. Based on what we've learned, a next generation of the survey would:
<ul>
    <li>involve consultations with trained sociologists</li>
    <li>collect demographic information by self-identification</li>
    <li>anonymously link conference attendees to their information</li>
    <li>test interventions, including online and anonymous questions</li>
</ul>

If you're interested in being part of such a thing (especially if you have time and funding), let me know!
