I was excited to participate in the 2019 [Astro Hack Week](http://astrohackweek.org/2019/)! Rumor has it that there were 300 applicatns for the 50 spots. It was an energizing week full of morning tutorials and lectures combined with afternoon hacking see [here](https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/AstroHackWeek2019/wiki/Detailed-Schedule) for a detailed schedule. 

All the lectures and tutorials are available on the [Hack Week github](https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/AstroHackWeek2019), I encourage you to check them out if you have even a little interest in data viz, querying surveys, bayesian inference, or machine learning. 

My favorite serious toy is [this site](https://playground.tensorflow.org) that lets you play with neural net nodes and activation functions. My favorite blowing-off-steam toy is the [gihpy account](https://giphy.com/channel/astrohackgif) we made to share our git puns and other gifs (upload still pending when I wrote this).
