Hi, I am Enes! I am a Computer Science senior with a DM in Electrical & Electronics Engineering in [Koç University](https://cs.ku.edu.tr/), Istanbul. 

I love creating projects and being involved in lots of stuff!

I was the co-founder and president of KU AIRS for two years. You can check out [here](https://airs.club/) and see what we have done. Our biggest project was __SPARK Autonomous Car Team__. We joined [Teknofest Robotaksi Contest](https://teknofest.org/en/yarisma-detaylar-6.html), the only self-driving car contest in Turkey. We have won [first place](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meerciyes_keepmaking-autonomouscars-ai-activity-6660190866252148736-kn_O) in the preliminary design & simulation phase in last year’s competition. This year, we built a full-scale autonomous car that is able to follow lanes, plan behaviours according to traffic signs and lights, park and complete the race track. 

I was also a [GLLP](https://glls.ku.edu.tr/) fellow and a [University Innovation Fellow](https://universityinnovation.org/wiki/Main_Page) - a fellowship organized by Stanford d.school - in my university. Here, me and my friends create projects to solve the most common problems in student life. I mostly contributed to the KULendar project, a comprehensive calendar portal for all kinds of events in our school. 

 I am currently working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [Autonomous Vision Group](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/), working on RL in end-to-end autonomous driving.
