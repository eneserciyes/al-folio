I spent 15 years in academia researching the smallest stars and why their magnetic fields are so strong. I extracted, analyzed, and visualized multi-dimensional and time-series data to answer my research questions, then communicated my results in seminars and scientific publications. I also mentored and supervised a handful of brilliant students through their masters degrees.

Currently, I'm working as a data scientist at a startup here in Berlin. My move from science to tech has been a lot of work, but it's also exciting to learn new skills and processes. 

I also like ice cream.
