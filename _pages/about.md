I'm an observational astronomer studying the smallest stars and warmest brown dwarfs. I work with photometry, spectroscopy, and in the time domain using data from both traditional observatories and large surveys. 

My main focus is on the magnetic fields of very small stars. Despite having cool and mostly neutral (not charged) surfaces, these stars can still have strong magnetic heating in their upper atmospheres. This heating results in energetic emission lines and occasional large explosions known as flares. Why do small stars have such strong magnetic fields? How do those fields and their interactions with the surface change as they age? 

I often work at the interface between stellar and Galactic astronomy. I examine trends in populations of stars, often using kinematics - positions and velocities - as an age indicator. I am also determining photometric metallicity indicators for the smallest stars. With accurate metallicites, millions of these stars can be used to uncover the chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

I view the the process of science as strongly connected to the community surrounding it. For me, this means a focus on building positive mentoring and collaborative relationships in my own scientific community and working on projects related to equity and inclusion.
