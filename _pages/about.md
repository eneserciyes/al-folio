I'm an observational astronomer working on the smallest stars and the warmest brown dwarfs. I work with photometry, spectroscopy, and in the time domain with data from both traditional observatories and large surveys. 

My main focus is on the magnetic fields of very small stars. Despite having cool and mostly neutral (not inoized) surfaces, these stars can still heat their upper atmospheres, producing energetic emission lines and occasional large explosions known as flares. Why do they have such strong magnetic fields, and how do those fields and their interactions with the surface change as the stars age? 

I also work at the interface between stellar astronomy and Galactic astronomy. I'm interested in using kinematics (stellar velocities) as an indicator of age because there are not many age indicators that work for the coolest stars. I'm also working on determining photometric indicators of metallicities for small stars, enabling their use as points in Galactic chemical evolution studies. 

This site is under construction, which mostly means the science + inclusion project descriptions are stubs and I am still hoping to make the mobile version smoother.  My out of date but complete site is [still available](http://www.sarahjaneschmidt.com).
