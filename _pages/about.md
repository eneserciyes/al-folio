I spent 15 years in academia researching the smallest stars and why their magnetic fields are so strong. My work was data-focused, and I extracted, analyzed, and visualized multi-dimensional and time-series data to answer my research questions. I also worked towards inclusion in astronomy. 

Now, I'm ready to take my data-focused skills and apply them to new challenges. To learn more about me, please take a look at my CV, publications, or the project summaries for some of my main projects.  

I also like ice cream.
