This site is under construction, so content will be missing and some things will be from the original template. My out of date but complete site is still available at [www.sarahjaneschmidt.com](http://www.sarahjaneschmidt.com).

I'm an observational astronomer working on the smallest stars and the warmest brown dwarfs. I want to understand their magnetic fields - both how they are traced through atmospheric indicators like emission lines and flares, and how they are linked to properties like surface temperature, age, and rotation. I also think of these ultracool dwarfs in the context of our Galaxy, and work to measure their chemical abundances and examine thier velocities to trace Galactic structure.

Often, the best way to attack these problems is by harnessing the power of surveys. I work with large spectroscopic datasets from SDSS, lightcurves from TESS, and distances from Gaia, and all available photometric surveys.
