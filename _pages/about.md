I am wrapping up a fifteen-year career as a research astronomer and working to find my first role outside academia as a data scientist. I am eager to figure out how everything works, and approach each new puzzle from a data-driven perspective. 

Like me, this site is in the middle of a move between worlds. Here, you'll find summaries and publications of my work as an academic. Science-wise, my projects used variety of different data sources to understand and classify stars based on tracers of their composition and magnetic fields. I also was active in multiple efforts focused on diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.
