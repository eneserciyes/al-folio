1. Being treated as junior when I have 15 years experience in my field. 

2. Not being cited and trying to figure out why. 

3. The job cycle and term positions. 

4. Grandstanding comments from the audience after talks. 

5. Ooops I'm not at work so I can't read that paywalled article. 

6. Bumping into the dude who sexually harassed me at conferences. 

7. Being told I have an advantage because I am a woman in the field. 

8. Constantly unclear expectations around "productivity" and "success." 

9. Normalized workaholism. 

10. Encroaching on native rights to build telescopes.
