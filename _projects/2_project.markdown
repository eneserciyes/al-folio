The H&alpha; emission line is generated in a magnetically heated upper layer of a star's atmosphere called its chromosphere. Through spectroscopic observations of large numbers of M and L dwarfs, we can examine this emission line to untangle patterns between spectral type, age, and magnetic field strength. There is also potential to understand more about the emission line in the time domain.
