The metallicities of the smallest stars are particularly difficult to determine due to their faint magnitudes and complicated spectra, yet K and M dwarfs are some of the most common stars in the galaxy so are some of the most promising hosts for nearby habitable planets and essential points in Galactic chemical evolution studies. We're working with data from APOGEE to leverage spectroscopic metallicities for a few thousand stars into photometric metallicities for millions of stars.
