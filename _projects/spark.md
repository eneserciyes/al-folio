Last year has been the most tiring yet the most rewarding year in my life. With the intention of creating a proactive culture in our school where people go beyond courses to develop themselves, I co-founded and led the SPARK Autonomous Car Team as the team captain. I led the production of a full-scale self-driving vehicle that is able to operate fully autonomously in a limited race environment. Mainly focusing on the software, I initiated the creation of the code base of our car in ROS using C++ and Python, formed the overall architecture and solutions and designed and implemented the drive-by-wire system with the control software. Our team, in its first year, became one of the five teams that was able to complete the parkour. I consider this experience and result as the proof of my proactive personality and my proficiency in a broad range of autonomous driving technologies.

Below, I present our simulation video and competition video from the race track. Our team suffered from a problem at an intersection, however was able to complete the parkour and successfuly park.

<b>Simulation video:</b> The simulation video was the first step in the competition. Our software was written with mostly Python on ROS2 and the simulation environment was created with SVL Simulator. Here, our car is able to follow the lane, stop and plan behaviour according to traffic light and signs and park autonomously.)

The parkour shows our car moving through the parkour correctly and parking autonomously. Unfortunately, we faced an unfortunate bug in an intersection. However, I am very proud to complete such a project with limited resources in COVID-19 conditions and complete the parkour to become one of a handful teams who can in our first year.
